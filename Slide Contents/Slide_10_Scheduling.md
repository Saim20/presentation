# Scheduling & Bottleneck Management

## Scheduling Approach

- **Master Production Schedule (MPS):** Weekly targets
- **Batch Grouping:** Same materials/machines together
- **Push System:** Make-to-stock based on forecasts

## Bottleneck Management

### Primary Bottlenecks
1. **Mold Changing & Setup**
   - SMED principles applied
   - Target: <10 minutes setup time

2. **Cycle Time**
   - Cooling & injection time constraints

3. **Post-Molding Processes**
   - Printing, labeling, assembly

### Solutions
- Track OEE of critical machines
- Preventative maintenance during off-peak
- Dedicated tooling facilities
