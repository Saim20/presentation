# Workflow & Layout Challenges

## Workflow Management

- **Linear workflow:** Design → Production → QC → Storage
- **JIT practices** for material delivery
- **SOPs** and real-time ERP monitoring
- Process-oriented layout with cellular zones

## Key Challenges

1. **Space Constraints**
   - Growing machine numbers vs. limited space

2. **Inter-Department Coordination**
   - Communication gaps between design, production, QC

3. **Material Handling**
   - Manual handling delays during peak hours

4. **Machine Downtime**
   - Mechanical faults impact scheduling
